# Product Context

## Problem
Organizations need to standardize and map raw skill inputs to canonical super-skills for analytics, reporting, and talent management. Manual mapping is error-prone and inefficient.

## Solution
This API automates skill-to-super-skill mapping using semantic similarity, providing endpoints for ingestion, mapping, and export. It supports batch processing and file uploads, and is designed for cloud deployment and integration with MongoDB.

## User Experience Goals
- Simple REST API for mapping and exporting skills
- Accurate, fast, and scalable matching
- Clear error messages and validation
- Easy setup, deployment, and extensibility
